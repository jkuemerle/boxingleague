                        <p>Our Commander Boxing League will follow a simiar ruleset as listed in Sheldon Menery's article on <a href="https://articles.starcitygames.com/magic-the-gathering/premium/an-introduction-to-commander-booster-box-league/" target="_blank">StarCity Games</a> but adjusted as follows:</p>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <p>
                            <h4>Card Pool</h4>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Each player will open a booster box (36 packs) of normal-release expansion or Core Set cards.  Un-sets, Masters sets, reprint-only sets, and other anthology products are not allowed.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Every other week (even if they have not played games the previous weeks), the player will open six (6) booster packs from a single set to add to their card pool.  The same stipulations apply (no Un-sets, etc.).  The additional restriction is that a player may not open packs from a card set from which they have already opened packs.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <i>Example</i><br/>
                            Brian chooses Core Set 2021 for his initial product.  After the second week, he chooses to open six packs of Amonkhet.  After that, both of those sets are unavailable to him, and so on.    
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <p>
                            <h4>Deck Construction</h4>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Deck construction follows all the <a href="https://mtgcommander.net/index.php/rules/" target="_blank">normal rules of Commander</a> regarding commander, color identity, deck size, and singleton nature.  The normal Commander banned list applies. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Players choose their commander from their original card pool, but are allowed to change it after opening booster packs.  A player doing so will notify the other players before the next round of games begins.
                        </p>
                    </div>                     
                    <div>
                        <p>
                            <h4>Rules</h4>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Games will follow the normal rules of Commander.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The League week will run from Monday to Sunday.  Players are welcome to schedule and play as many games with the other league members as they like.  As much as possible, each player will report their results into the the scoring system. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Results are based on the size of the pod and how the player performed in each game. A player in a pod of 4 who is eliminated first has a result of &quot;Beat 0 opponents&quot;, the second player eliminated in that pod has a result of &quot;Beat 1 opponent&quot;, the third player eliminated has a result of &quot;Beat 2 opponents&quot;, and the final player has a result of &quot;Beat 3 opponents&quot;.</p>
                        </p>
                            If two or more players are eliminated at the same time, then all players who were eliminated at the same time have a &quot;tied&quot; result. For example, in a pod of 4 if Player 1 is eliminated first, they have a result of &quot;Beat 0 opponents&quot;, Player 2 and Player 3 are eliminated at the same time so both of those players have a result of &quot;Beat 1 opponent, Tied 1 opponent&quot; and Player 4 has a result of &quot;Beat 3 opponents&quot;. 
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <p>
                            <h4>Scoring</h4>
                        </p>
                        <p>Each player will be awarded points based on their game results. Each opponent that a player &quot;outlasts&quot; in a game is worth 2 points. Each tie is worth 1 point per opponent tied with. For example: in a pod of 4, Player 1 is eliminated first so they receive 0 points. Plasyer 2 and Player 3 are eliminated at the same time so they both receive 2 points for outlasting Player 1 and 1 point for drawing with each other for a total of 3 points each. Player 4 outlasted 3 opponents so they receive 6 points. </p>
                        <p>Standings will be regularly calculated from the reported results and posted here. This league is for fun so all players are reposnosible for providing their own prize support.</p>
